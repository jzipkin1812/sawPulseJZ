This repo contains a couple different assignments from MAT 240B, a class at UCSB for Winter 2026, taught by Karl Yerkes.

## Assignment 2
In this assignment, I create my first JUCE plugin, which produces 3 different waveforms using frequency modulation. It has parameters to modify the gain, frequency, filter, and waveform type.

## Assignment 3
I refactored my plugin and changed it to take MIDI input.

## Assignment 4
I added a separate plugin that uses the Karplus-Strong algorithm to simulate a plucked string. There are three different initial noise burst settings that grant the synth some different timbres.
